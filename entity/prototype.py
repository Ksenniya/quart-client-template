Here's a prototype implementation for the `prototype.py` file based on the specifications you've provided:

```python
from quart import Quart, request, jsonify
from quart_schema import QuartSchema
import httpx
import logging
import asyncio
from datetime import datetime

app = Quart(__name__)
QuartSchema(app)

# Initialize logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Local cache to simulate persistence
entity_job = {}

@app.route('/hello', methods=['GET'])
async def hello():
    return jsonify({"message": "Hello World"}), 200

@app.route('/greet', methods=['POST'])
async def greet():
    data = await request.get_json()
    name = data.get("name", "").strip()

    if not name:
        return jsonify({"error": "Name is required."}), 400

    # Fire and forget the processing task
    requested_at = datetime.now()
    job_id = len(entity_job) + 1  # Simple job ID generation
    entity_job[job_id] = {"status": "processing", "requestedAt": requested_at}
    
    await asyncio.create_task(process_entity(job_id, name))

    return jsonify({"message": f"Hello, {name}!"}), 200

async def process_entity(job_id, name):
    try:
        # Placeholder for external API call or complex logic
        # TODO: Implement actual processing logic here
        # Example of an external API call (mocked)
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.get(f"https://api.example.com/endpoint?name={name}")
            # Process the response as needed
            # TODO: Handle the response from the external API

        # Mark job as completed in the cache
        entity_job[job_id]["status"] = "completed"
        logger.info(f"Processed entity job {job_id} for {name}")

    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(e)
        entity_job[job_id]["status"] = "error"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(use_reloader=False, debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8000, threaded=True)
```

### Key Points:
- The `/hello` endpoint returns a simple "Hello World" message.
- The `/greet` endpoint accepts a name and responds with a personalized greeting.
- Processing of the greeting is handled asynchronously, simulating a job that could involve external API calls or complex logic.
- Local caching is used to store job statuses, with a simple dictionary acting as the cache.
- Proper logging is included for monitoring and debugging.
- Placeholder comments (`TODO`) indicate where additional functionality or error handling should be implemented once requirements are finalized.
