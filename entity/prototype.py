### Notes:
- The `/hello` endpoint returns a simple greeting.
- The `/start-job` endpoint simulates starting a job and processes it asynchronously.
- The actual API call in `process_entity` is currently pointing to a placeholder URL (`https://api.example.com/data`). Replace it with a real API endpoint as needed.
- Logging is implemented to capture any exceptions during processing.
- This prototype serves as a foundation to verify user experience and identify gaps in requirements.
