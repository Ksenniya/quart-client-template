# Based on the provided `git diff`, here are the changes that have been made to the `prototype.py` code:
# 
# ### Changes Made:
# 1. **Removed Unused Imports**: The import statement for `dataclass` was removed since it was no longer being used.
#   
# 2. **DTO Implementation**: 
#    - The `ReportRequest` class was refactored to use Pydantic's `BaseModel` for request validation, which is the correct approach for validating incoming requests.
#   
# 3. **Validation Decorator**: 
#    - The `@validate_request(ReportRequest)` decorator was modified to `@validate_request`, indicating that the request validation is now being handled implicitly within the function.
# 
# 4. **Response Format Change**: 
#    - In the response of the `generate_report` function, the return statement was changed from returning just the `report_id` to returning the full `report` object. The line:
#      ```python
     return jsonify({"status": "success", "report_id": report_id})
#      ```
#      was changed to:
#      ```python
     return jsonify({"status": "success", "report": report})
#      ```
# 
# ### Fully Functioning `prototype.py` Code
# Incorporating these changes, below is the complete and fully functioning `prototype.py` code:
# 
# ```python
