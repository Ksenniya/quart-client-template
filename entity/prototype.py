Here is a prototype implementation of the application in a `prototype.py` file. This code incorporates the structure and requirements you've provided, including API calls to a real Cats API, local caching, and logging.

```python
import logging
import asyncio
from quart import Quart, request, jsonify
from httpx import AsyncClient
from quart_schema import QuartSchema

app = Quart(__name__)
QuartSchema(app)

# Configure logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Local cache for storing results
entity_job = {}

# Function to process the data retrieval from the Cats API
async def process_entity(entity_id, data):
    async with AsyncClient() as client:
        try:
            response = await client.get(f"https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?limit={data['limit']}&breed_ids={data['breed']}")
            response.raise_for_status()
            results = response.json()
            entity_job[entity_id]["results"] = results
            logger.info(f"Data retrieved for {entity_id}: {results}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception(e)
            entity_job[entity_id]["status"] = "error"

@app.route('/cats/data', methods=['POST'])
async def retrieve_cats_data():
    data = await request.get_json()
    entity_id = str(len(entity_job) + 1)  # Simple ID generation
    requested_at = asyncio.get_event_loop().time()
    
    entity_job[entity_id] = {"status": "processing", "requestedAt": requested_at}
    
    # Fire and forget the processing task
    await asyncio.create_task(process_entity(entity_id, data))
    
    return jsonify({"status": "processing", "entity_id": entity_id})

@app.route('/cats/results', methods=['GET'])
async def get_cats_results():
    entity_id = request.args.get('entity_id')
    if entity_id in entity_job:
        return jsonify({"status": "success", "results": entity_job[entity_id]})
    else:
        return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": "Entity ID not found"}), 404

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(use_reloader=False, debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8000, threaded=True)
```

### Notes:
- This code uses `httpx.AsyncClient` for making asynchronous HTTP requests to the Cats API.
- The `entity_job` dictionary acts as a local cache to store the processing status and results.
- The `process_entity` function retrieves cat data from the API based on user input.
- Logging is implemented to capture any exceptions during the API call.
- The `retrieve_cats_data` endpoint is responsible for initiating the data retrieval process and returning the status.
- The `get_cats_results` endpoint retrieves the results based on the entity ID.
- Remember to install the required packages with `pip install quart httpx quart-schema` to run this prototype.

This prototype is designed to validate the user experience and identify any gaps in the requirements.
