# Below is a prototype implementation of the `prototype.py` file using Quart for the API framework and aiohttp for HTTP requests. The prototype adheres to the specifications you've provided and uses mock data or placeholders where necessary. 
# 
# ```python
from quart import Quart, request, jsonify
from quart_schema import QuartSchema, validate_request
import aiohttp
import pandas as pd

app = Quart(__name__)
QuartSchema(app)

# Placeholder for local cache
local_cache = {}

@app.route('/report/generate', methods=['POST'])
@validate_request
async def generate_report():
    data = await request.get_json()
    url = data.get('url')

    # Step 1: Download data
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            if response.status != 200:
                return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": "Failed to download data."}), 500
            csv_data = await response.text()

    # Step 2: Load data into DataFrame
    try:
        from io import StringIO
        df = pd.read_csv(StringIO(csv_data))
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": f"Failed to load data into DataFrame: {str(e)}"}), 500

    # Step 3: Validate DataFrame columns
    expected_columns = [
        "Address", "Neighborhood", "Bedrooms", "Bathrooms", 
        "Square Meters", "Building Age", "Garden", "Garage", 
        "Floors", "Property Type", "Heating Type", "Balcony", 
        "Interior Style", "View", "Materials", "Building Status", 
        "Price (£)"
    ]
    if not all(col in df.columns for col in expected_columns):
        return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": "Missing expected columns in data."}), 400

    # Step 4: Perform analysis
    # TODO: Handle data inconsistencies or missing values
    average_price = df['Price (£)'].mean()
    property_distribution = df['Property Type'].value_counts().to_dict()
    summary_statistics = {
        "average_bedrooms": df['Bedrooms'].mean(),
        "average_bathrooms": df['Bathrooms'].mean(),
        "average_square_meters": df['Square Meters'].mean()
    }

    # TODO: Generate visualizations and save as URLs
    visualizations = {
        "price_distribution_chart": "URL_to_chart",  # Mock URL
        "property_type_distribution_chart": "URL_to_chart"  # Mock URL
    }

    # Step 5: Create report
    report = {
        "average_price": average_price,
        "property_distribution": property_distribution,
        "summary_statistics": summary_statistics,
        "visualizations": visualizations
    }

    # TODO: Consider caching the report locally if needed
    local_cache['latest_report'] = report

    return jsonify({"status": "success", "report": report})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(use_reloader=False, debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8000, threaded=True)
# ```
# 
# ### Key Components of the Prototype:
# - **API Endpoint**: The `/report/generate` endpoint allows users to generate a report based on the provided URL for the CSV file.
# - **Data Download**: The prototype uses `aiohttp` to fetch the data asynchronously.
# - **DataFrame Handling**: The CSV data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and basic validation checks are performed on the expected columns.
# - **Analysis**: Simple calculations for average price and property distribution are implemented.
# - **Local Cache**: A mock local cache is used to store the latest report for potential future use.
# 
# ### TODO Comments
# - **Data Inconsistencies**: The prototype currently does not handle data inconsistencies or missing values; this needs to be addressed in the final implementation.
# - **Visualizations**: URLs for visualizations are mocked, and the logic to generate actual charts/graphs needs to be defined.
# - **Caching Logic**: The local caching strategy should be expanded based on how you plan to use this feature.
# 
# This implementation serves as a foundation for verifying user experience and identifying any gaps in the requirements before proceeding with a more robust solution. Feel free to reach out for any further modifications or clarifications!
