Below is an example prototype.py that meets the requirements. Keep in mind that this implementation uses an in‑memory cache (a simple Python dict) to simulate persistence, and any external API calls are made to placeholder URLs with TODO comments indicating where further details are needed.

"""
Prototype implementation for verifying the user experience (UX)
and identifying gaps in the requirements before a full implementation.

Notes:
 • Uses Quart as the async web framework with QuartSchema.
 • Uses aiohttp.ClientSession for HTTP requests.
 • Uses a simple in‑memory dict to simulate persistence.
 • External API calls or model calculations are mocked with placeholders.

------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation of key points:
1. The app uses Quart along with QuartSchema to allow for future schema validation if needed.
2. A simple in‑memory dictionary (company_cache) simulates persistence.
3. The /companies endpoints support GET (list all) and POST (create new).
4. An additional endpoint /companies/<business_id>/analyze shows how to use aiohttp.ClientSession for an external call.
5. All placeholders (e.g., external API URL and error handling) include TODO comments for further details.

This prototype should serve as a starting point for verifying the UX and establishing any missing requirements.
