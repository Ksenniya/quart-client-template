Below is one complete updated version that moves the “fire‐and‐forget” background logic completely into the workflow function. In other words, the POST controller now just receives and minimally packages the data, and then delegates all asynchronous processing (job id assignment, timestamping, scheduling the processing task) to the workflow function. This makes the controller lighter and frees it from excessive logic.

Note that in the workflow function (named here process_companies for the “companies” entity_model) you are allowed to modify the entity (for example, add new timestamps or attributes) before it is persisted. You then schedule an asynchronous task (via asyncio.create_task) to run the real processing (process_entity). Also note that you CANNOT call entity_service.add_item/update/delete on the current entity inside the workflow function – you only modify the incoming dictionary.

Below is the complete code:

Key points in this refactoring:

1. The POST endpoint is now very lean. It accepts the incoming request, converts it to a plain dictionary, and calls entity_service.add_item – passing the workflow function process_companies.

2. The workflow function (process_companies) is responsible for:
   • Enriching the entity with a unique job_id, timestamps, and setting initial attributes.
   • Scheduling an asynchronous task (fire‑and‑forget) to call process_entity.

3. The processing function (process_entity) and the helper fetch_lei remain as before. They simulate calling an external API, filtering, and enriching the results.

4. Note that if an error occurs within process_entity, the code shows an example of “direct_update” to modify the current entity state. (This is a placeholder for any mechanism that picks up changes to the entity – note that within the workflow function you are not allowed to call entity_service.add_item/update on the same entity.)

This approach cleanly separates controller logic from processing logic and shows how any asynchronous tasks can be entirely offloaded to the workflow function.
