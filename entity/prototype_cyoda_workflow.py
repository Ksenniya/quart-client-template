Yes, that's exactly the idea. By moving the non‐controller logic into dedicated workflow functions (e.g., process_report for "report" entities), we can keep our endpoints lean and focused solely on retrieving and passing data. This separation of concerns makes it easier to maintain and test each part of the system. Here are some thoughts on what logic might be moved:

1. Pre‐Persistence Enrichment:  
 • Instead of building a full report payload inside the endpoint (adding timestamps, updating statuses, etc.), you can offload that to the workflow function.  
 • The workflow function can add common metadata (like the creation time or default statuses) to the entity.  

2. Synchronous Business Logic:  
 • Any logic that is purely about adjusting or validating the entity before saving it is an excellent candidate.  
 • For example, you could move logic that sets flags (like “preprocessed” fields, or “initiated from”: IP address, etc.) into the workflow function.  

3. Async Tasks vs. Synchronous Flow:  
 • When it comes to fire‐and‐forget asynchronous tasks—like sending an email, updating external APIs, or similar work—the workflow function might not be the best place because it is usually expected to run synchronously before persistence.  
 • However, if you have preliminary steps that do not require waiting on external calls (or can be made asynchronous inside the workflow if your infrastructure supports that), then you might combine them in a workflow function.  
 • Often, though, it’s best to simply offload the asynchronous work (like reporting or notifications) to background tasks immediately after the entity is persisted. This way the persistence operation isn’t held up by network or API calls.

4. Cleaner Controllers and Robust Code:  
 • The controllers become thin wrappers that accept input, trigger the right workflow (or service) method, and then return a response.  
 • This approach improves robustness because each part (controller, workflow, async tasks) is responsible for a separate concern. It’s also easier to test your business logic in isolation.

So, you can refactor your code by moving all pure data adjustments (that don’t require long-running external calls) into functions like process_report (or more generally process_{entity_name}). For example, setting initial entity statuses or preparing a payload for persistence is ideal for a workflow function. In contrast, longer asynchronous tasks (such as fetching external data, sending emails, or updating records post‐persistence) should remain as fire-and-forget background tasks or be handled by a job queue.

In summary, absolutely—if we can move more synchronous pre-processing logic (validations, defaults, enrichment) into the workflow functions, our controllers will be cleaner and our overall design more modular and robust.
