Below is one complete refactored version of the file. In this version the entity_service.add_item call now passes the additional workflow function (process_companies_search) as a parameter. The workflow function is defined to take the job’s entity (a dict) as its only argument, update its state (adding timestamps, fetching and enriching company data) and return the modified entity. Notice that the search payload is stored inside the job entity under the key "query" so that it becomes available to the workflow function.

──────────────────────────────

Notes on the changes:
1. The call to entity_service.add_item now includes the parameter workflow=process_companies_search.
2. The workflow function process_companies_search takes the job’s entity data as its only argument, uses the search payload (stored under "query") to perform the external API calls and enrichment, and then updates the entity’s state.
3. The original separate asynchronous task (via asyncio.create_task(process_entity(...))) has been removed since the workflow function now encapsulates the data processing.
4. The external service is expected to call the workflow function asynchronously before finally persisting the entity.
