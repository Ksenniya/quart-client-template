Yes, that's exactly the right approach. By moving asynchronous tasks and business logic into the workflow function (process_{entity_name}), the controller endpoints become much leaner and solely responsible for handling requests and responses. This separation of concerns leads to more robust and maintainable code because:

1. The controllers remain focused on input validation and response formatting, while the heavy lifting (like calling external APIs, data enrichment, and asynchronous processing) is delegated.

2. Asynchronous tasks, fire‑and‑forget operations, and enrichment logic can run asynchronously inside the workflow, ensuring that operations that don’t impact the immediate client response are handled efficiently.

3. It reduces the risk of inadvertently triggering recursive calls (since you’re not updating the current entity via the service but rather modifying it directly) and keeps the concerns of persistence separate from the business logic.

4. It provides a direct mechanism to modify the entity state before persistence—simply by updating the entity dictionary (like entity['attribute'] = new_value)—which is both explicit and easier to test.

In summary, moving logic into a dedicated workflow function (process_{entity_name}) supports asynchronous code and frees your controllers from excessive logic; it is a cleaner, scalable, and more maintainable design pattern.
