Below is one acceptable complete solution. In this version we update the add_item call so that a new workflow function (process_companies) is passed as a parameter. This function is defined as an async function that is applied to the entity data (the “job”) before it is persisted. In our case we “embed” the original enrichment logic (previously in process_entity) inside process_companies. Notice that we attach the input criteria to the job payload so that process_companies has all the data it needs. (Keep in mind that within the workflow you are allowed to change the entity state, but you must not persist changes via add_item/update_item on the same entity_model, otherwise infinite recursion may occur.)

Below is the complete updated code:

-------------------------------------------------

Explanation of the changes:
1. The add_item call in the POST endpoint now includes workflow=process_companies.
2. The job payload (job_data) now carries the original input criteria so that the workflow function can perform entity enrichment.
3. The new async workflow function process_companies is implemented. It calls the external Finnish Companies Registry API, filters and enriches the data and then modifies the job entity state accordingly.
4. Since the workflow function handles processing internally before the entity persistence, there is no longer an explicit asyncio.create_task to trigger background processing.

This code meets the integration requirement with the external entity_service that now applies a workflow function before persisting the entity.
