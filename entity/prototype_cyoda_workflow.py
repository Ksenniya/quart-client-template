Yes, we definitely can – and even should – move many pieces of logic from the controllers into the workflow functions. This approach has a few clear benefits:

• It isolates the transformation and pre‐persistence business logic (such as adding timestamps, validating certain fields, or launching background tasks) from the HTTP controller logic. The endpoints then become leaner and focus purely on request/response, while workflow functions take care of “what to do” with the data before it is saved.

• By moving fire‐and‐forget tasks (like triggering asynchronous operations, updating statuses, or even starting notifications) into the workflow functions, you centralize related logic. This makes your codebase more robust and easier to test because all of the entity preprocessing is encapsulated in specific functions (process_user, process_post, etc.).

• It allows you to easily adjust or extend behavior (for example, adding additional checks or logging) on a per‑entity basis in one specific place without touching multiple endpoints. In turn, this separation of concerns should make maintenance and future changes far simpler.

That said, there are some points to consider:

1. The workflow functions must be designed carefully so that any asynchronous tasks within them (if needed) are well managed. Depending on the requirements, you may want the workflows to return immediately, or wait until certain actions finish. Often, a fire‐and‐forget background task (which could be launched via asyncio.create_task) is appropriate when you don’t need to delay the persistence step.

2. The design of the workflow functions must consider error handling; if an error occurs during processing, you’ll need to decide whether to abort persistence or to log the issue and continue.

3. Not every piece of logic may be a candidate for a workflow—if the logic is essential to the integrity of the request, it might belong in the controller. But tasks like adding side effects, triggering external jobs, or applying some transformations are perfect candidates for the workflow functions.

Overall, moving pre‑persistence logic—including async fire‑and‑forget tasks—into process_{entity_name} functions helps keep the controllers focused and your code more modular and robust.
