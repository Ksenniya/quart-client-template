Yes, that's exactly the idea. By moving the logic into the workflow functions (like process_{entity_name}), you encapsulate the business rules and data processing in a separate, dedicated component. This separation of concerns offers several benefits:

1. Cleaner Endpoints – The controller becomes slim and only responsible for routing, validation, and interfacing with the external entity service. This makes your endpoints more readable and easier to maintain.

2. Testability – Encapsulating the logic inside the workflow functions makes it easier to write unit tests for your business logic independently from the web framework.

3. Reusability – If you have similar logic applied across different endpoints or parts of your application, placing this logic in standalone functions makes it easier to reuse without duplicating code.

4. Robustness – Isolating the processing logic reduces the risk of accidentally mixing concerns. Modifications to business logic won’t require changes to your controller, and vice versa.

Overall, moving the business logic into a workflow function that gets invoked just before persisting the entity will make your code more modular and maintainable.
