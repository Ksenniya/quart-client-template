Below is the complete refactored application. In this version we “push” all processing logic into an asynchronous workflow function (process_companies) that is passed as the workflow parameter to entity_service.add_item. All the previously “fire‐and‐forget” processing (external API calls, data enrichment, error handling, etc.) has been moved inside process_companies so that the controller is left “thin” (only gathering input, creating a job record, and returning a job id).

IMPORTANT DESIGN NOTES:
1. The job entity now contains an extra field (searchParams) that holds the original search parameters. This is required so that the workflow function has everything it needs without the caller having to pass extra data.
2. The workflow function (process_companies) is defined as an async function that takes a single argument (the job entity). It performs all asynchronous operations (calling the external PRH API, enriching companies with LEI data, and updating the job’s state) inside a try/except block. In case of errors it sets an error flag on the entity.
3. We explicitly do not call entity_service.add_item/update_item for the same entity_model inside the workflow—for example, we do not try to “persist” changes by calling update_item. Instead the workflow function directly mutates the job entity. The new (final) entity state is automatically persisted by the external persistence engine.
4. We take care to use sensible timeouts and exception handling (for example, if the PRH API call returns a non‐OK status or raises an exception, we mark the job “failed”). In a production system you might add additional retry/timeout handling.
5. Since the workflow function supports asynchronous code, it is a proper replacement for “fire and forget” background tasks. The process is automatically scheduled (by entity_service.add_item) so that the controller can immediately reply with the job id.

Below is the complete code:

"""
Refactored application using an external persistence service.
All processing logic (including external API calls, enrichment with LEI, etc.)
has been moved into an asynchronous workflow function (process_companies) which
is passed as a parameter (workflow) to the entity_service.add_item method.
This leads to a thinner controller layer and a more robust architecture.

Notes:
 • For a POST/PUT, the route decorator comes first, then validate_request, then validate_response.
 • For GET endpoints with query parameters, validate_querystring comes first.
 • All persistence actions are only performed on different entity_models inside the workflow.
   The workflow function only modifies the current job entity (by mutating its dictionary),
   and the new state is persisted automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------

OVERALL REASONING & PREVENTIVE MEASURES:
• All asynchronous tasks are handled inside process_companies. External API calls have a timeout; any error leads to a proper error message in the job entity.
• The job entity gathers the search parameters so that process_companies do not need extra data from the controller.
• The workflow is designed so that it does not perform add/update/delete operations for the same entity_model—only direct mutation is allowed.
• The controller immediately returns a job id while the workflow function runs asynchronously.
• Extensive logging and exception handling safeguards against unexpected errors.
  
This complete refactored code meets the requirement to free controllers from excessive logic while ensuring robust error handling and asynchronous processing.
