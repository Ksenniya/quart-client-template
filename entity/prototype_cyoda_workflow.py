Yes, absolutely. Moving logic away from the controller endpoints and into specialized workflow functions (for example, process_build or process_{entity_name}) can lead to a cleaner design. Here’s why and how we might do it:

1. Separation of Concerns – By pushing processing logic into workflow functions, the endpoints become responsible only for request validation, preparing the input data, and returning the response. The actual work (such as updating build status, firing off async tasks, or processing the build record) can then be managed separately. This separation makes the code easier to read and maintain.

2. Reusability – With workflow functions, you can reuse business logic across different endpoints or services, reducing duplication. If you ever need to adjust the way the build entity is processed before persistence or update its state, you only have to modify the workflow function.

3. Easier Testing – Isolating the processing logic inside workflow functions means you can write unit tests targeting those functions alone, without having to simulate an endpoint’s request/response cycle.

4. Improved Robustness – With centralized processing logic, error handling and retries can be managed in one place. For example, any asynchronous fire-and-forget tasks (like contacting TeamCity or calling external services) can be wrapped in the workflow function, ensuring that all entities go through the same lifecycle steps.

One example might be moving the logic that kicks off the asynchronous build processing task. Instead of having the endpoint:
• Call entity_service.add_item (with the workflow parameter)
• And then separately calling asyncio.create_task(process_build(…))
you could have the workflow function itself schedule the asynchronous task after (or during) data transformation. Note, however, that if you want to return a response to the client immediately (with minimal latency), you have to be cautious about any long or blocking operations in the workflow. Often it’s best to keep such operations fire‐and‐forget at one level (or use a message queue) while still centralizing the decision logic in the workflow function.

For example, the workflow function could be refactored like this (for “build” entities):

------------------------------------------------------------
async def process_build_workflow(entity):
    # Perform synchronous data modifications
    if "requestedAt" not in entity:
        entity["requestedAt"] = current_timestamp()
    entity["workflowApplied"] = True

    # Optionally, schedule the asynchronous processing task.
    # You might want to ensure that scheduling this task does not delay persistence.
    asyncio.create_task(process_build(entity["teamcity_build_id"], entity["type"]))
    return entity
------------------------------------------------------------

Then, your endpoint would simply prepare the entity data and call:
------------------------------------------------------------
new_id = await entity_service.add_item(
        token=cyoda_token,
        entity_model="build",
        entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,
        entity=build_data,
        workflow=process_build_workflow
)
------------------------------------------------------------

This way, the endpoint is “free” from both the fire-and-forget logic and the low-level business processing, keeping it lean while still allowing the workflow function to incorporate the necessary async task scheduling.

So, in summary, yes—it’s a good candidate for refactoring. By moving relevant logic (especially asynchronous tasks or intricate processing steps) into dedicated workflow functions, you improve the robustness, maintainability, and testability of your system while keeping your controller endpoints focused solely on request and response management.
