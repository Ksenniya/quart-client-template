Yes, absolutely. Moving business logic and especially asynchronous fire‐and‐forget tasks into dedicated workflow functions can greatly improve the clarity and maintainability of your code. By isolating the logic that prepares or transforms the entity before persistence into functions like process_entity (or process_{entity_name}), you separate concerns: the controllers become thin and primarily responsible for request/response handling, while the workflow functions encapsulate the domain logic and any asynchronous operations that must happen before saving the entity.

Some potential benefits include:

• Cleaner endpoints: The controllers only need to validate, prepare the incoming data, and delegate to the workflow. This leads to less cluttered code in your endpoints.

• Reusability & consistency: By centralizing pre-persistence transformations or side-effects in workflow functions, you ensure the same logic is applied regardless of where the entity is created. This avoids duplicating code in multiple endpoints or parts of the application.

• Easier testing: Isolating complex business and asynchronous logic means you can test these workflows separately from the web layer, which can simplify unit testing and debugging.

• Future flexibility: If you ever need to change how you pre-process or validate an entity right before storing it, you only need to update the workflow function rather than revisiting multiple endpoints.

Note however that:
• The workflow functions should remain decoupled from request-specific details.
• You need to ensure that any asynchronous tasks within the workflow are properly managed (error logging, retry policy, etc.).
• Not every logic should be moved into workflows if it affects how the endpoint responds; critical logic that influences the outcome of the request may need to remain in the controller.

In summary, shifting fire-and-forget tasks and pre‑persistence logic into dedicated workflow functions (workflow=process_{entity_name}) is a recommended pattern that can lead to a more robust, modular, and maintainable architecture.
