Below is a complete, refactored version of the application. The code moves all the asynchronous and “fire‑and‑forget” business logic into a workflow function (process_companies) that is passed to entity_service.add_item. In this approach the HTTP controller is lightweight: it simply parses the client request and immediately persists the initial job entity. All further processing (retrieving data from external services, filtering, enrichment, and error‐handling) is encapsulated in the workflow function. Note that the workflow function does not call any further add/update/delete on the same entity_model; instead it modifies the current entity (job record) so that the updated state is later persisted by the external service. Also, extra care is taken to catch exceptions and to avoid potential issues such as infinite recursion or unhandled errors.

------------------------------------------------

Explanation and reasoning:

1. The endpoint (POST /companies/search) is now very thin. It creates an initial job record and immediately passes it—with the search parameters—to entity_service.add_item along with the workflow function process_companies.
2. The workflow function (process_companies) is fully asynchronous and performs all the heavy lifting before the entity is persisted. It retrieves companies, filters for active ones, enriches each company with LEI data, updates the job record and handles errors that might occur.
3. All functions (including external API calls) catch exceptions and log errors to prevent any unhandled errors that might break the process.
4. The GET endpoint fetches the current job entity and returns informative HTTP statuses depending on whether the job is still processing, completed, or encountered an error.
5. Comments and error handling have been added to help prevent potential issues such as missing search parameters, network interruptions, or unhandled exceptions during asynchronous calls.

This design “frees” the controllers from excessive logic and makes the asynchronous workflow modular, robust, and easier to maintain.
