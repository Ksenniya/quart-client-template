Absolutely—it’s a great idea. By moving the asynchronous or “fire‐and‐forget” business logic from the endpoint into a dedicated workflow function (e.g., process_{entity_name}), we can decouple and isolate the business processing from the HTTP handling. This has several benefits:

1. Cleaner controllers: The endpoints become thin wrappers that handle request/response concerns only, making them easier to read, test, and maintain.

2. Improved robustness: When the business logic is encapsulated in self-contained, asynchronous workflow functions, it can be independently developed, tested, and evolved. It directly supports asynchronous patterns and error handling, reducing the risk of unintended side effects in the controller.

3. Scalability: Since workflow functions are designed to run asynchronously, they enable better scaling when handling long-running or resource-intensive tasks without blocking HTTP responses.

4. Maintainability and flexibility: Centralizing the processing logic in workflow functions allows for more reusable code. If the entity processing workflow needs to evolve (e.g., interact with new external APIs or refactor business rules), changes can be made in one place rather than in multiple endpoints.

In short, offloading the async processing to workflow functions not only “frees” your controllers from excessive logic but also creates a more robust and modular architecture—exactly as required.
