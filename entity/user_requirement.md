## Detailed Summary of User Requirement

The user has expressed the need to develop an application that interacts with the Petstore API to retrieve and display details of pets based on user input. The application should facilitate an easy and efficient user experience, providing pet information through a clear interface. The following components and functionalities are specified as part of the requirements:

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Requirement**: The application must be capable of retrieving pet details from the Petstore API.
- **Specifics**:
  - The data ingestion process should occur on-demand, meaning it should be triggered whenever a user inputs a new pet ID.
  - The application must utilize a specific pet ID to request data from the Petstore API.

### 2. Data Display
- **Requirement**: Once the pet details are retrieved, the application should present this information to the user.
- **Details to Display**:
  - **Name**: The name of the pet.
  - **Category**: The category of the pet (e.g., dog, cat).
  - **Status**: The current status of the pet (e.g., available, sold).
  - **Photo**: An image representing the pet.

### 3. User Interaction
- **Requirement**: The application must allow users to input a pet ID.
- **Functionality**:
  - Users should have a simple interface to enter the pet ID they wish to retrieve information for.
  - Upon submission, the application should initiate the data ingestion process to fetch the relevant pet details.

### 4. Notifications
- **Requirement**: The application should provide feedback to users regarding the pet ID input.
- **Functionality**:
  - If a user enters an invalid pet ID, the application must notify the user.
  - The notification should clearly indicate that the provided pet ID is invalid, allowing the user to retry with a correct ID.

### Summary of User Goals
The primary goal of this application is to facilitate an effortless way for users to retrieve and view pet details from the Petstore API using a specific ID. The user expects a seamless experience where they can easily input their queries and receive clear and informative responses, including notifications in case of errors or invalid inputs.

### Additional Considerations
- **Error Handling**: The application should have robust error handling mechanisms to manage scenarios where the API request fails or returns invalid data.
- **Responsiveness**: The application should ensure that interactions are quick and user-friendly, minimizing delays in retrieving and displaying data.

The details outlined above provide a comprehensive overview of the user requirements for the application, highlighting the critical functionalities and interactions expected from the system.
