# Here is the polished version of the `deploy_user_app` function, which includes the necessary logic to make the entity job workflow fully functional based on your provided information. Since there are no supplementary functions provided, I will complete the existing function without adding new ones.
# 
# ```python
import json
import logging
from aiohttp import ClientSession
from app_init.app_init import entity_service
from common.config.config import ENTITY_VERSION

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

ENTITY_MODEL = 'user_app'

async def deploy_user_app(data, meta={'token': 'cyoda_token'}):
    """
    Create a new user_app.

    Complete business logic
    """
    try:
        # Validate input data (you can add more validation as needed)
        if 'repository_url' not in data or 'is_public' not in data:
            raise ValueError("Invalid data: 'repository_url' and 'is_public' are required.")
        
        # Process data for deployment
        app_data = {
            'repository_url': data['repository_url'],
            'is_public': data['is_public']
        }

        # Save the user_app entity
        app_id = await entity_service.add_item(
            token=meta['token'],
            entity_model=ENTITY_MODEL,
            entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,
            entity=app_data
        )
        logger.info(f"User app deployed successfully with ID: {app_id}")

    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(e)
        raise
# ```
# 
# ### Explanation:
# 1. **Input Validation**: The function checks if the required fields (`repository_url` and `is_public`) are present in the input data. If not, it raises a `ValueError`.
# 
# 2. **Processing Data**: The relevant data for the user app is prepared for deployment.
# 
# 3. **Saving the Entity**: The `entity_service.add_item` method is called to save the user app, logging the success message with the generated app ID.
# 
# 4. **Error Handling**: Exceptions are caught and logged, and the exception is re-raised to propagate the error.
# 
# This code is structured to fit into an asynchronous workflow, assuming that the `entity_service` is properly set up to handle the `add_item` calls. Adjust any specific logic to fit your application's needs.
