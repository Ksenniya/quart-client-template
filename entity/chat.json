This decision may influence the design of the persistence mechanism.\n\n2. **Link Entity Structure**: Are there any additional attributes required for the Link Entity beyond those listed (type, rel, title, href, hreflang)? For instance, would you like to include a timestamp for when the link was ingested or a source identifier?\n\n3. **Data Retrieval Frequency**: How often do you expect the ingestion process to run? This information will help in designing the scheduling mechanism (e.g., cron jobs, event-driven architecture).\n\n4. **Error Handling Strategy**: Can you specify what actions should be taken on encountering different types of errors? For example, should the application retry a failed request a certain number of times before logging it?\n\n5. **API Rate Limits**: Are you aware of any rate limits for the API endpoints? If so, how should the application handle those limits to avoid being blocked?\n\n6. **Testing and Validation**: How will you validate the successful ingestion and processing of data? Consider implementing unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the entire ingestion flow.\n\n7. **Additional APIs**: If you plan to add more APIs in the future, how do you envision the extraction logic to accommodate this? Would you prefer a modular design where each API can be handled independently?\n\n8. **Logging Details**: What specific information should be included in the error logs? For instance, do you want to log the full response from the API on failure, or just the error message?\n\nThese questions aim to clarify functional aspects and ensure that all necessary requirements are captured.

Then, when calling entity_service.add_item, the workflow function is passed as the workflow parameter so that the entity is pre\u2011processed before being persisted.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n# prototype.py\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom quart import Quart, request, jsonify\nfrom quart_schema import QuartSchema, validate_request, validate_response, validate_querystring\nimport aiohttp\nimport asyncio\nimport uuid\nimport datetime\n\n# Import external service and constants\nfrom app_init.app_init import entity_service, cyoda_token\nfrom common.config.config import ENTITY_VERSION\nfrom common.repository.cyoda.cyoda_init import init_cyoda\n\napp = Quart(__name__)\nQuartSchema(app)  # Initialize QuartSchema\n\n# The required startup initialization\n@app.before_serving\nasync def startup():\n    await init_cyoda(cyoda_token)\n\n# Workflow function that processes the link entity before persistence.\ndef process_link(link_entity: dict) -> dict:\n    # Example logic: add a timestamp and a processed flag to the entity.\n    link_entity[\"processedAt\"] = datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat()\n    link_entity[\"processed\"] = True\n    return link_entity\n\n# Data classes for validation\n@dataclass\nclass IngestPayload:\n    # Example input for POST /ingest-links.

Moving business logic and especially asynchronous fire\u2010and\u2010forget tasks into dedicated workflow functions can greatly improve the clarity and maintainability of your code. By isolating the logic that prepares or transforms the entity before persistence into functions like process_entity (or process_{entity_name}), you separate concerns: the controllers become thin and primarily responsible for request/response handling, while the workflow functions encapsulate the domain logic and any asynchronous operations that must happen before saving the entity.\n\nSome potential benefits include:\n\n\u2022 Cleaner endpoints: The controllers only need to validate, prepare the incoming data, and delegate to the workflow. This leads to less cluttered code in your endpoints.\n\n\u2022 Reusability & consistency: By centralizing pre-persistence transformations or side-effects in workflow functions, you ensure the same logic is applied regardless of where the entity is created. This avoids duplicating code in multiple endpoints or parts of the application.\n\n\u2022 Easier testing: Isolating complex business and asynchronous logic means you can test these workflows separately from the web layer, which can simplify unit testing and debugging.\n\n\u2022 Future flexibility: If you ever need to change how you pre-process or validate an entity right before storing it, you only need to update the workflow function rather than revisiting multiple endpoints.\n\nNote however that:\n\u2022 The workflow functions should remain decoupled from request-specific details.\n\u2022 You need to ensure that any asynchronous tasks within the workflow are properly managed (error logging, retry policy, etc.).\n\u2022 Not every logic should be moved into workflows if it affects how the endpoint responds; critical logic that influences the outcome of the request may need to remain in the controller.\n\nIn summary, shifting fire-and-forget tasks and pre\u2011persistence logic into dedicated workflow functions (workflow=process_{entity_name}) is a recommended pattern that can lead to a more robust, modular, and maintainable architecture.", "answer": "", "function": {}, "index": 0, "iteration": 0, "max_iteration": 0, "data": {}, "entity": {}, "file_name": "entity/prototype_cyoda_workflow.py", "context": {}, "approve": true, "editable": false, "publish": false, "flow_step": "Gathering requirements"}, {"question": null, "prompt": {"text": "\nPlease return complete refactored application with all functions implemented.

In this version we have moved as much business logic as possible out of the HTTP controllers and into dedicated \u201cworkflow\u201d and helper functions. In particular, the asynchronous ingestion work is now split into several dedicated functions:\n\n\u2022 fetch_external_links \u2013 contacts external endpoints (collection and items) and returns a consolidated list of links.  \n\u2022 process_link \u2013 a workflow function that is invoked by the persistence layer (via entity_service.add_item) to perform pre\u2011persistence modifications on a link entity (for example, adding a timestamp and setting a processed flag).  \n\u2022 deduplicate_and_persist_link \u2013 checks whether the link already exists by its \u201chref\u201d attribute and, if not, calls entity_service.add_item with process_link as its workflow parameter.  \n\u2022 process_ingestion \u2013 the fire\u2011and\u2011forget function (previously all inside the endpoint) that calls fetch_external_links and iterates over each link, invoking deduplicate_and_persist_link for every candidate. It also updates the job summary accordingly.  \n\nBy isolating this logic into separate functions we \u201cfree\u201d the controllers from excessive logic while making the overall flow easier to test and maintain. We have also inserted additional error handling (guarding against unexpected exceptions) and notes about potential pitfalls (for example, avoiding infinite recursion if a workflow on the same entity type internally calls entity_service.add_item).\n\nBelow is the full code:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n# prototype.py\n\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any\nfrom quart import Quart, request, jsonify\nfrom quart_schema import QuartSchema, validate_request, validate_response, validate_querystring\nimport aiohttp\nimport asyncio\nimport uuid\nimport datetime\n\n# Import external service and constants\nfrom app_init.app_init import entity_service, cyoda_token\nfrom common.config.config import ENTITY_VERSION\nfrom common.repository.cyoda.cyoda_init import init_cyoda\n\napp = Quart(__name__)\nQuartSchema(app)  # Initialize QuartSchema\n\n# ---------------------- Startup Initialization ---------------------- #\n@app.before_serving\nasync def startup():\n    await init_cyoda(cyoda_token)\n\n# ---------------------- Workflow and Helper Functions ---------------------- #\n\ndef process_link(link_entity: dict) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Workflow function for a Link entity.

The external fetching logic is grouped into small helper functions so that network errors can be caught, logged, and even inserted into the summary as errors.  \n2. Process_ingestion no longer mixes HTTP concerns with business logic. Instead, it calls fetch_external_links and then iterates through each potential link, delegating duplicate checking and persistence to deduplicate_and_persist_link.  \n3. The process_link workflow function ensures that any transformation needed before persisting a Link is done in one place. This \u201cfreeing\u201d of the controllers makes them lean and focused on request/response handling only.  \n4. We guard against missing or faulty data (for example, links without a valid href) and also avoid a scenario where process_link might trigger infinite recursion (by not calling persistence methods on a \u201clink\u201d which is being processed).  \n5. The JOBS dictionary and associated endpoints provide a simple way to monitor asynchronous background tasks.\n\nThis refactored application divides concerns in a robust and flexible manner and helps prevent common issues that might arise when business logic clutters controller implementations.", "answer": "", "function": {}, "index": 0, "iteration": 0, "max_iteration": 0, "data": {}, "entity": {}, "file_name": "entity/prototype_cyoda_workflow.py", "context": {}, "approve": true, "editable": false, "publish": false, "flow_step": "Gathering requirements"}, {"question": "Prototype with persistence and workflow to Cyoda Entity Database is  Ready for Validation\n", "prompt": null, "answer": null, "function": null, "iteration": 0, "flow_step": "Gathering requirements", "max_iteration": 0, "approve": true, "stack": "app_building_stack", "publish": true, "question_key": "Prototype with persistence and workflow to Cyoda Entity Database is  Ready for Validation\n", "processed": true}, {"question": null, "prompt": {}, "answer": "why do you think that workflow function is strictly synchronous", "function": {"name": "finish_flow"}, "index": 2, "iteration": 0, "file_name": "entity/chat.json", "notification_text": "\n\ud83c\udf89 **Chat flow has been saved!** \ud83c\udf89\n\nThe chat flow has been successfully saved to `entity/chat.json`.
