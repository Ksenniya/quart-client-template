For example, replace `CHAT_ID_VAR` with `$chat_id` and fill in other necessary values.\n\n    You might need to specify the path to .env file in your IDE run configurations.\n\n3. **Start Your Application**:\n    Once you've updated the `.env` file, you can start your application by running:\n    ```bash\n    python app.py\n    ```\n    or just run the app.py in your IDE.\nPlease also update your api.py files to use cyoda_token until authentication featute is fully implemented.

What user roles or permissions should be considered (e.g., admin, regular user)?\n2. Should the application support versioning of the API?\n3. Will there be a need for user notifications upon build status changes?\n4. Are there specific data validation requirements for the input fields?\n\nThese points should help refine your application's functional requirements and improve the overall API design.",
