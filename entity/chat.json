Typically, a GET request is sufficient for a simple \"Hello World\" response.\n\n3. **Response Format**: Determine the format of the response. Should it be plain text, JSON, or something else?\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Consider how to handle possible errors, such as invalid requests or server errors. \n\n5. **Static Files**: Decide if there will be any static files (like HTML or CSS) that need to be served, or if the application will solely respond to API requests.\n\n6. **Testing**: Outline any functional testing that should be conducted to ensure the endpoint works as expected.\n\nQuestions for clarification:\n- Are there any specific requirements for how the response should be formatted (e.g., in JSON)?\n- Do you require any additional endpoints or functionalities beyond the basic \"Hello World\" response?\n- Is there a specific environment or deployment scenario you have in mind (local development, cloud, etc.)?\n\nThese considerations will help formulate a more detailed specification in the next iterations.
