For example, replace `CHAT_ID_VAR` with `$chat_id` and fill in other necessary values.\n\n    You might need to specify the path to .env file in your IDE run configurations.\n\n3. **Start Your Application**:\n    Once you've updated the `.env` file, you can start your application by running:\n    ```bash\n    python app.py\n    ```\n    or just run the app.py in your IDE.\nPlease also update your api.py files to use cyoda_token until authentication featute is fully implemented.

How will users obtain their tokens?\n\n2. **User Management**: Will there be a need for user roles (e.g., admin, regular user), and how will you handle permissions for deploying applications?\n\n3. **Environment Configuration**: Are there specific environment configurations that users should be able to manage beyond the `user_name`, such as different environments (e.g., staging, production)?\n\n4. **Error Handling**: What should the API return in case of errors (e.g., invalid requests, failed deployments)? Would you like to standardize error responses?\n\n5. **Response Structure**: You mentioned returning a build ID for certain actions. Should the API responses include additional metadata about the deployment, such as timestamps or deployment status?\n\n6. **Endpoint Naming**: To comply with RESTful principles, consider using plural nouns for endpoints (e.g., `/deploy/cyoda-envs` and `/deploy/user-apps`). Would you like to adopt this naming convention?\n\n7. **GET Requests**: For the status and statistics endpoints, should the API return historical data for past builds or just current status?\n\n8. **Cancellation**: Should users only be able to cancel their own builds, or can they cancel builds initiated by others?\n\nThese points can help refine your API design and ensure it meets your needs. Once we clarify these aspects, we can work on a more formal specification for the application.",

Currently, the code uses local in\u2011memory dictionaries (and counters) to store and manage data for one or more entity types. Your task is to refactor the code so that all interactions with the local cache are replaced by calls to an external service called entity_service (from app_init.app_init import entity_service).\n\nFor each entity type (represented by the placeholder {entity_name}), perform the following replacements:\n\nCreating a new entity (typically via a POST endpoint):\nBefore: The code validates the input and adds the new entity to a local dictionary, using a counter to generate an ID.\nAfter: Replace that logic with a call to:\nentity_service.add_item(\n    token=token,\n    entity_model=\"{entity_name}\",\n    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,  # always use this constant\n    entity=data  # the validated data object\n)\nRetrieving a single entity (typically via a GET endpoint with an ID):\nBefore: The code retrieves the entity from the local dictionary.\nAfter: Replace that logic with:\nentity_service.get_item(\n    token=token,\n    entity_model=\"{entity_name}\",\n    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,\n    technical_id=<id>\n)\nMake sure <id> corresponds to the identifier extracted from the request.\nRetrieving all entities (typically via a GET endpoint without an ID):\nBefore: The code returns the list of all entities stored in the local dictionary.\nAfter: Replace that with a call to:\nentity_service.get_items(\n    token=token,\n    entity_model=\"{entity_name}\",\n    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,\n)\nUpdating and Deleting entities:\nignore this for now\nCleanup:\nNotes:\nAssume that token and ENTITY_VERSION are defined and available in the scope.\nPreserve the endpoint routes and any other essential business logic.\nRemove all comments.
