You should decide on the format based on how you want your users or clients to interact with your application.\n\n3. **Endpoints**: If you want a simple \"Hello World\" app, a single endpoint would suffice. However, if you envision adding features in the future, consider structuring your application to accommodate additional routes.\n\n4. **Deployment**: If you plan to deploy the app, it would be helpful to know your preferred platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.) to provide deployment-specific guidance. If it's for local development, we can focus on that for now.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implementing error handling and logging mechanisms is generally a good practice.

The implementation should be a working prototype rather than a fully robust solution. Incorporate any details I\u2019ve already specified\u2014such as external APIs, models, or specific calculations\u2014and use mocks or placeholders only where requirements are unclear or incomplete.

The goal is to verify the user experience (UX) and identify any gaps in the requirements before we proceed with a more thorough implementation. Please double-check you are using all the information provided earlier. Use httpx.AsyncClient for http requests, and Quart api.
