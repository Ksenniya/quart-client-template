For example, replace `CHAT_ID_VAR` with `$chat_id` and fill in other necessary values.\n\n    You might need to specify the path to .env file in your IDE run configurations.\n\n3. **Start Your Application**:\n    Once you've updated the `.env` file, you can start your application by running:\n    ```bash\n    python app.py\n    ```\n    or just run the app.py in your IDE.\nPlease also update your api.py files to use cyoda_token until authentication featute is fully implemented.

Will the configuration vary significantly between these environments?\n\n4. **Build Properties**: The properties `user_defined_keyspace` and `user_defined_namespace` are set to the `user_name`. Should these values be configurable by the user, or should they default to the username?\n\n5. **Error Handling**: What kind of error responses should the API provide? For example, should it return specific error codes for different issues like authentication failure or validation errors?\n\n6. **Rate Limiting**: Is there a need for rate limiting on any of the endpoints to prevent abuse?\n\n7. **Response Structure**: What should the response format look like for each endpoint? Should it include additional metadata, such as timestamps or status messages?\n\n8. **Cancel Action**: For the cancel action, should users have permissions to cancel builds they didn't initiate? \n\n9. **RESTful Improvements**: To enhance the API's RESTful nature, consider using plural nouns for resource endpoints (e.g., `/deploy/cyoda-envs`, `/deploy/user-apps`) and standardizing the response format.\n\n10. **Documentation**: How will you document the API for users? Consider using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI for clear specifications.\n\nThese considerations will help create a more robust formal specification for your application in the next iteration.",

We suggest using **event-driven design** with **entities** and **state machines**. This approach has proven to work exceptionally well for **high-availability** and **data-intensive** applications, ensuring scalability and simplicity.\n\n### What are **Entities**? \ud83e\udd14\nEntities are **data units** that represent real-world objects. Each entity has a **lifecycle**, **states**, and **transitions** that define how it evolves over time.\n\n### Our Approach: \ud83d\udca1\n- **Entities** represent things like a **Light Bulb** \ud83d\udca1.\n- **State Machines** visualize the **lifecycle** of entities (states + transitions) \ud83d\udd04.\n- **Event-Driven Architecture** triggers actions based on events, making systems responsive and scalable \u26a1.\n\n### Simple Light Bulb Example \ud83d\udca1:\n- **States**:  \n  - **OFF** \ud83d\udeab  \n  - **ON** \u2705\n\n- **Transitions**:  \n  - **New** \u2192 OFF (initial state)  \n  - **Flip Switch** \u2192 ON  \n  - **Flip Switch Again** \u2192 OFF\n---\n\n### Light Bulb Flowchart:\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> OFF\n    OFF --> ON : Flip Switch\n    ON --> OFF : Flip Switch Again\n```    \n\ud83c\udf89 Let\u2019s dive into creating your project\u2019s **entities** and **workflow** to build a scalable and data-intensive system! \n\nFor more on entity databases, check out this article by [Paul Schleger](https://medium.com/@paul_42036/whats-an-entity-database-11f8538b631a) \ud83d\udcda.\n",
