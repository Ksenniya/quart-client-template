Identifying these could improve reliability.\n   - Should there be a timeout or a maximum number of retries for fetching LEI data to prevent prolonged delays?\n\n4. **Output**:\n   - Apart from JSON and CSV, do you require any other output formats?\n   - Should the output include additional metadata, such as the time of the request or the total number of companies found?\n\n5. **Error Handling**:\n   - How should the application handle different error scenarios from the API (e.g., rate limiting, server errors)?
