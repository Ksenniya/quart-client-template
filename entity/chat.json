Instead, we save and update job records using:\n   \u2022 entity_service.add_item for the POST (search) endpoint (this call returns an id that we include in the response).\n   \u2022 entity_service.update_item inside the background processing function to update job records (with enriched company data, completedAt, etc.).\n   \u2022 entity_service.get_item on the GET endpoint to retrieve job records.\n\n2. The startup function now initializes the cyoda repository using init_cyoda(cyoda_token).\n\n3. The API endpoints themselves (routes and validations) remain unchanged from a business logic perspective; only the caching layer has been replaced.\n\n4. TODO comments remain to indicate where additional logic, mapping, error\u2011handling, or production API endpoints might be needed.\n\nMake sure that entity_service\u2019s implementation supports these functions (and that its API is asynchronous if required).

In the POST endpoint, the call to entity_service.add_item now includes the extra parameter workflow=process_companies. This provides an asynchronous \u201chook\u201d that runs on the job record before it is persisted.\n2. The newly implemented workflow function (process_companies) takes the job record (entity) as its only argument, extracts the search parameters (companyName and filters), fetches and filters companies from the external PRH API, enriches them with LEI information, and updates the job state (status, completedAt, results). In the event of an error, it sets the status to \"error\" and stores the error message.\n3. The GET endpoint remains the same, reading the (possibly updated) job record from the external repository.\n\nThis complete revision removes the previous manual background task scheduling and now relies on the workflow function provided to entity_service.add_item to process the entity asynchronously before final persistence.", "answer": "", "function": {}, "index": 0, "iteration": 0, "max_iteration": 0, "data": {}, "entity": {}, "file_name": "entity/prototype_cyoda_workflow.py", "context": {}, "approve": true, "editable": false, "publish": false, "flow_step": "Gathering requirements"}, {"question": null, "prompt": {"text": "\nWhat do you think, can we move any logic from the endpoint inside newly added functions (workflow=process_{entity_name}) that will be invoked right before persisting entity.\nIt will make our code more robust and will 'free' the controllers from excessive logic.\nAny async task (including fire and forget functions) is definitely a candidate to be replaced with process_{entity_name} function as workflow function supports asynchronous code and is a direct alternative for such tasks.

That allows controllers to remain thin, only handling request parsing and response formatting, while all the heavy lifting (data retrieval, filtering, enrichment, etc.) happens separately inside the workflow function. \n\nFor example, in the companies search scenario, you can remove the fire\u2011and\u2011forget task from the endpoint and let the workflow (process_companies) do the following just before the entity is persisted:\n\n\u2022 Retrieve companies from the external API (e.g., PRH),  \n\u2022 Filter out inactive companies,  \n\u2022 Enrich the companies with supplementary data (such as LEI) by calling asynchronous functions, and  \n\u2022 Set the resulting state (status, completedAt, results, or error if needed) directly on the entity.\n\nBecause the workflow function supports asynchronous code, it\u2019s a much cleaner solution than launching a separate background task. Remember, within this workflow function you must not call entity_service.add/update/delete for the current entity\u2014instead, simply modify the entity object (e.g. entity[\"attribute\"] = new_value) to affect its state; the new state will then be persisted by the entity_service. \n\nThis design separates concerns: your controllers handle HTTP I/O while the workflow function encapsulates the business logic and any additional asynchronous processing (like fetching and enriching data). It also simplifies error handling and potential retries since all the processing logic is consolidated in one function. \n\nIn summary, yes, moving the asynchronous tasks into process_{entity_name} is the right approach\u2014it makes your codebase more maintainable, the controllers \"lighter,\" and the asynchronous logic more directly tied to the persistence of the entity.", "answer": "", "function": {}, "index": 0, "iteration": 0, "max_iteration": 0, "data": {}, "entity": {}, "file_name": "entity/prototype_cyoda_workflow.py", "context": {}, "approve": true, "editable": false, "publish": false, "flow_step": "Gathering requirements"}, {"question": null, "prompt": {"text": "\nPlease return complete refactored application with all functions implemented.

The endpoint (POST /companies/search) is now very thin. It creates an initial job record and immediately passes it\u2014with the search parameters\u2014to entity_service.add_item along with the workflow function process_companies.\n2. The workflow function (process_companies) is fully asynchronous and performs all the heavy lifting before the entity is persisted. It retrieves companies, filters for active ones, enriches each company with LEI data, updates the job record and handles errors that might occur.\n3. All functions (including external API calls) catch exceptions and log errors to prevent any unhandled errors that might break the process.\n4. The GET endpoint fetches the current job entity and returns informative HTTP statuses depending on whether the job is still processing, completed, or encountered an error.\n5. Comments and error handling have been added to help prevent potential issues such as missing search parameters, network interruptions, or unhandled exceptions during asynchronous calls.\n\nThis design \u201cfrees\u201d the controllers from excessive logic and makes the asynchronous workflow modular, robust, and easier to maintain.", "answer": "", "function": {}, "index": 0, "iteration": 0, "max_iteration": 0, "data": {}, "entity": {}, "file_name": "entity/prototype_cyoda_workflow.py", "context": {}, "approve": true, "editable": false, "publish": false, "flow_step": "Gathering requirements"}, {"question": null, "prompt": {}, "answer": null, "function": {"name": "refresh_context", "model_api": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.7}}, "iteration": 0, "flow_step": "Entities design", "max_iteration": 0, "stack": "app_building_stack"}, {"question": null, "function": {"name": "register_workflow_with_app", "model_api": {"model": "o3-mini", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 10000}, "prompt": {"text": "\nWhich workflow would you recommend for this code?  \nCould you split this code into functions, each function should have name starting with 'process_'.\nIt can take only one argument entity data and can modify entity data state.
