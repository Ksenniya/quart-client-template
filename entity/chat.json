The workflow function (process_companies) is built to catch and handle errors at every step:\n   \u2022 It verifies the existence of the required companyName.\n   \u2022 It checks for the external API response status.\n   \u2022 It attempts to safely parse the JSON payload.\n   \u2022 It verifies that the expected keys exist in the API response.\n   \u2022 It wraps the entire API call process in a try/except block to prevent any unhandled exceptions.\n   \n2. The initial job record includes the companyName. This prevents potential issues where the workflow function would\n   otherwise fail due to missing input data.\n\n3. Instead of using fire-and-forget tasks in the controller, all asynchronous processing is performed inside the workflow\n   function. This ensures that the data passed from the controller is processed consistently before persistence.\n   \n4. In the GET endpoint, a simple retrieval of the job record is performed with proper validation. If no job is found, an\n   appropriate error response is returned.\n   \n5. The startup hook includes error logging to catch any issues during the initialization of external dependencies.\n\nThis refactored application is robust, with clear separation of concerns between input handling (controllers) and business logic\n(the workflow function), making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.", "answer": "", "function": {}, "index": 0, "iteration": 0, "max_iteration": 0, "data": {}, "entity": {}, "file_name": "entity/prototype_cyoda_workflow.py", "context": {}, "approve": true, "editable": false, "publish": false, "flow_step": "Gathering requirements"}, {"question": null, "prompt": {}, "answer": null, "function": {"name": "refresh_context", "model_api": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.7}}, "iteration": 0, "flow_step": "Entities design", "max_iteration": 0, "stack": "app_building_stack"}, {"question": null, "function": {"name": "register_workflow_with_app", "model_api": {"model": "o3-mini", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 10000}, "prompt": {"text": "\nWhich workflow would you recommend for this code?  \nCould you split this code into functions, each function should have name starting with 'process_'.\nIt can take only one argument entity data and can modify entity data state.
