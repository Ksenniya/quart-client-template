For example, replace `CHAT_ID_VAR` with `$chat_id` and fill in other necessary values.\n\n    You might need to specify the path to .env file in your IDE run configurations.\n\n3. **Start Your Application**:\n    Once you've updated the `.env` file, you can start your application by running:\n    ```bash\n    python app.py\n    ```\n    or just run the app.py in your IDE.\nPlease also update your api.py files to use cyoda_token until authentication featute is fully implemented.

Will there be a user registration and login process? How will tokens be issued and managed?\n\n2. **User Management**: Should the application support different user roles (e.g., admin vs. regular user)? How will user data be stored and retrieved?\n\n3. **Deployment Configuration**: \n   - For the `POST /deploy/cyoda-env` and `POST /deploy/user_app` endpoints, what validation should be in place for `user_name`, `repository_url`, and `is_public`?\n   - Are there any restrictions on the types of repositories that can be deployed (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)?\n\n4. **Build Queue Management**: \n   - How will you handle errors or failures in the build process? Should there be a retry mechanism?\n   - What is the expected response format for the build ID returned?\n\n5. **Status and Statistics Retrieval**:\n   - What specific metrics or data should be included in the statistics response? \n   - Will there be a need for pagination or filtering if the number of builds for a user becomes large?\n\n6. **Cancel Build Functionality**: \n   - Are there any conditions under which a build cannot be canceled (e.g., if it\u2019s already in progress)?\n   - Should there be any notifications or logs for canceled builds?\n\n7. **Improving RESTfulness**: \n   - Consider using nouns for resource names (e.g., `/deployments`, `/users`) and use proper HTTP methods for CRUD operations. \n   - For example, a `GET /deployments/{id}` could replace the status retrieval, and a `DELETE /deployments/{id}` could be used for canceling.\n\nBy addressing these points, we can create a clearer and more robust specification for your backend application.

This is not persistent and will lose data when the application restarts.\n- **Mock External API**: The `queue_build` function simulates the behavior of making a call to the external API. The response is mocked with the `build_counter`.\n- **TODO Comments**: I've placed TODO comments to indicate where further implementation is necessary or where the logic needs to be fleshed out.\n- **Dynamic Data Handling**: The API endpoints accept and return dynamic data based on the user's requests.\n\nThis prototype should serve as a basis for verifying the user experience and identifying any gaps in the requirements.

Currently, the code uses local in\u2011memory dictionaries (and counters) to store and manage data for one or more entity types. Your task is to refactor the code so that all interactions with the local cache are replaced by calls to an external service called entity_service (from app_init.app_init import entity_service).\n\nFor each entity type (represented by the placeholder {entity_name}), perform the following replacements:\n\nCreating a new entity (typically via a POST endpoint):\nBefore: The code validates the input and adds the new entity to a local dictionary, using a counter to generate an ID.\nAfter: Replace that logic with a call to:\nentity_service.add_item(\n    token=token,\n    entity_model=\"{entity_name}\",\n    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,  # always use this constant\n    entity=data  # the validated data object\n)\nRetrieving a single entity (typically via a GET endpoint with an ID):\nBefore: The code retrieves the entity from the local dictionary.\nAfter: Replace that logic with:\nentity_service.get_item(\n    token=token,\n    entity_model=\"{entity_name}\",\n    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,\n    technical_id=<id>\n)\nMake sure <id> corresponds to the identifier extracted from the request.\nRetrieving all entities (typically via a GET endpoint without an ID):\nBefore: The code returns the list of all entities stored in the local dictionary.\nAfter: Replace that with a call to:\nentity_service.get_items(\n    token=token,\n    entity_model=\"{entity_name}\",\n    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,\n)\nUpdating and Deleting entities:\nignore this for now\nCleanup:\nNotes:\nAssume that token and ENTITY_VERSION are defined and available in the scope.\nPreserve the endpoint routes and any other essential business logic.\nRemove all comments.
