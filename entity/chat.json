The previously used in-memory storage (entity_jobs) has been entirely removed.\n3. The constant ENTITY_MODEL is defined as \"companies_search\" (feel free to change this value if a different entity name is required).\n4. The startup code initializes the cyoda service as required.\n5.

Notice that the search payload is stored inside the job entity under the key \"query\" so that it becomes available to the workflow function.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport asyncio\nimport uuid\nimport datetime\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom quart import Quart, jsonify, request, abort\nfrom quart_schema import QuartSchema, validate_request, validate_response  # Also use validate_querystring if needed\nimport aiohttp\n\n# New imports for external service usage\nfrom common.config.config import ENTITY_VERSION\nfrom app_init.app_init import cyoda_token, entity_service\nfrom common.repository.cyoda.cyoda_init import init_cyoda\n\napp = Quart(__name__)\nQuartSchema(app)  # single-line integration per requirements\n\n# Startup hook for initializing cyoda as required\n@app.before_serving\nasync def startup():\n    await init_cyoda(cyoda_token)\n\n# Define the entity_model name for this module (used in all entity_service calls)\nENTITY_MODEL = \"companies_search\"\n\n# Dataclasses for validation\n@dataclass\nclass CompanySearchRequest:\n    companyName: str  # Required field, using only primitives\n\n@dataclass\nclass JobResponse:\n    jobId: str\n    message: str\n\n# Constants for external APIs\nPRH_API_BASE = \"https://avoindata.prh.fi/opendata-ytj-api/v3/companies\"\nLEI_API_BASE = \"https://example.com/lei-lookup\"  # Placeholder URL\n\nasync def fetch_companies(company_name: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Fetch companies from the Finnish Companies Registry API by company name.\"\"\"\n    params = {\"name\": company_name}\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n        async with session.get(PRH_API_BASE, params=params) as resp:\n            if resp.status != 200:\n                # TODO: Improve error handling based on PRH API errors.\n                return []\n            data = await resp.json()\n            # Assuming data format is similar to { \"results\": [ { company data }, ... ] }\n            return data.get(\"results\", [])  # Placeholder extraction\n\nasync def fetch_lei(company_info: dict) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Fetch LEI for a company using an external LEI lookup service.\"\"\"\n    # TODO: Replace this mock with a real API call.\n    # For demonstration, assume if the length of companyName is even, an LEI is found.\n    if len(company_info.get(\"companyName\", \"\")) % 2 == 0:\n        return \"MOCK-LEI-1234567890\"\n    return \"Not Available\"\n\nasync def process_companies_search(entity: dict) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Workflow function applied to the job entity before it is persisted.\n    \n    It expects the job entity to contain a 'query' key with the original search payload.\n    This function updates the job with a requestedAt timestamp, fetches companies from the PRH API,\n    filters, enriches them by performing LEI lookup and then updates the entity state to \"completed\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # Record the current time as the request time.\n    entity[\"requestedAt\"] = datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat()\n\n    # Obtain the search parameters stored under \"query\"\n    search_payload = entity.get(\"query\", {})\n    company_name = search_payload.get(\"companyName\", \"\")\n    \n    # 1.

The workflow function process_companies_search takes the job\u2019s entity data as its only argument, uses the search payload (stored under \"query\") to perform the external API calls and enrichment, and then updates the entity\u2019s state.\n3.

In our current setup the endpoint is doing some heavy lifting by firing off an async task to process the data. By moving that logic into the workflow function (process_{entity_name}) we simplify our controller code and encapsulate all asynchronous business logic where it belongs. This approach has several benefits:\n\n1. Cleaner Controllers. The endpoint now only creates the initial entity record and returns a job ID. It doesn\u2019t carry the weight of asynchronous processing logic.\n2. Robust Asynchronous Logic. Since the workflow function supports asynchronous code and runs immediately before persistence, it\u2019s the perfect place for fetching external data, filtering, enriching, and even triggering supplementary operations.\n3. Better Separation of Concerns. The workflow function can modify the entity\u2019s state directly (e.g. entity['attribute'] = new_value), while the controller remains free of side effects.\n4. Avoiding Infinite Recursion. Since we no longer call entity_service.add/update/delete on the current entity in the workflow function, we prevent potential recursion problems.\n\nBelow is a complete refactored code example that shows how all the logic previously contained in a fire\u2010and\u2010forget async task can be moved into the workflow function.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport asyncio\nimport datetime\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom quart import Quart, jsonify, abort\nfrom quart_schema import QuartSchema, validate_request, validate_response\nimport aiohttp\n\n# New imports for external service usage\nfrom common.config.config import ENTITY_VERSION\nfrom app_init.app_init import cyoda_token, entity_service\nfrom common.repository.cyoda.cyoda_init import init_cyoda\n\napp = Quart(__name__)\nQuartSchema(app)  # single-line integration per requirements\n\n# Startup hook for initializing cyoda as required\n@app.before_serving\nasync def startup():\n    await init_cyoda(cyoda_token)\n\n# Define the entity_model name for this module (used in all entity_service calls)\nENTITY_MODEL = \"companies_search\"\n\n# Dataclasses for validation\n@dataclass\nclass CompanySearchRequest:\n    companyName: str  # Required field\n\n@dataclass\nclass JobResponse:\n    jobId: str\n    message: str\n\n# Constants for external APIs\nPRH_API_BASE = \"https://avoindata.prh.fi/opendata-ytj-api/v3/companies\"\nLEI_API_BASE = \"https://example.com/lei-lookup\"  # Placeholder URL\n\nasync def fetch_companies(company_name: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetch companies from the Finnish Companies Registry API by company name.\n    \"\"\"\n    params = {\"name\": company_name}\n    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\n        async with session.get(PRH_API_BASE, params=params) as resp:\n            if resp.status != 200:\n                # TODO: Improve error handling based on PRH API errors.\n                return []\n            data = await resp.json()\n            # Assuming data format is similar to { \"results\": [ { company data }, ... ] }\n            return data.get(\"results\", [])\n\nasync def fetch_lei(company_info: dict) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Fetch LEI using an external LEI lookup service.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For demonstration, assume if the length of companyName is even, an LEI is found.\n    if len(company_info.get(\"companyName\", \"\")) % 2 == 0:\n        return \"MOCK-LEI-1234567890\"\n    return \"Not Available\"\n\nasync def process_companies_search(entity: dict) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Workflow function applied to the job entity before persistence.\n\n    This function updates the job's state: it timestamps the request, fetches companies,\n    filters and enriches them, and then updates the status.

Note that the workflow function modifies the entity\u2019s state directly (and must not call add/update/delete on the current entity), so the new state will be persisted automatically. \n\nPotential issues we\u2019ve considered include:  \n\u2022\u2002If the external PRH API returns a non-200 response (or raises an HTTP error) the function logs the error and returns an empty list.  \n\u2022\u2002If no company name is provided in the query, the workflow updates the entity status to \u201cfailed.\u201d  \n\u2022\u2002Any unexpected error (either in fetching data or during enrichment) is caught, logged, and the entity is marked as \u201cfailed\u201d with empty results so that the client sees a consistent state.  \n\u2022\u2002We also use exception handling inside the startup hook and in the endpoints so that issues with initialization or persistence are caught and properly logged.\n\nHere is the complete code:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport asyncio\nimport datetime\nimport logging\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\n\nfrom quart import Quart, jsonify, abort\nfrom quart_schema import QuartSchema, validate_request, validate_response\nimport aiohttp\n\n# External service imports and configuration constants\nfrom common.config.config import ENTITY_VERSION\nfrom app_init.app_init import cyoda_token, entity_service\nfrom common.repository.cyoda.cyoda_init import init_cyoda\n\n# Create the Quart app and integrate with quart-schema for validation.\napp = Quart(__name__)\nQuartSchema(app)\n\n# Setup logging to output errors and info\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# Startup hook for initializing external services.\n@app.before_serving\nasync def startup():\n    try:\n        await init_cyoda(cyoda_token)\n        logger.info(\"Cyoda has been initialized successfully.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        logger.exception(\"Cyoda initialization failed!\")\n        raise e\n\n# Define the entity_model for this module.\nENTITY_MODEL = \"companies_search\"\n\n# Data classes for request and response validation.\n@dataclass\nclass CompanySearchRequest:\n    companyName: str  #

The workflow function (process_companies_search) receives the job entity as its only argument. It directly updates the entity (adding a timestamp, storing the results, and setting the status) so that when the workflow finishes, the new state is persisted by entity_service without needing a separate update.\n2. All asynchronous tasks \u2013 external API calls for fetching companies and LEI data \u2013 are encapsulated in functions (fetch_companies and fetch_lei). Error handling is built in so that any temporary failure is logged and the workflow can mark the job as \"failed\" if the input is insufficient.\n3. The controller (POST /api/companies/search) is \u201cfree\u201d of heavy logic; it only creates the job entry (via entity_service.add_item) and returns the job id.\n4. The GET endpoint simply retrieves the job record and informs the client if the job is still processing or returns the complete results.\n5. Robustness is enhanced by logging errors at every step and ensuring that exceptions are caught so that the application always returns a valid status to the client.\n\nThis approach ensures that all asynchronous and heavy processing is isolated inside the workflow function, leading to a simpler and more maintainable controller design.", "answer": "", "function": {}, "index": 0, "iteration": 0, "max_iteration": 0, "data": {}, "entity": {}, "file_name": "entity/prototype_cyoda_workflow.py", "context": {}, "approve": true, "editable": false, "publish": false, "flow_step": "Gathering requirements"}, {"question": null, "prompt": {}, "answer": null, "function": {"name": "refresh_context", "model_api": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.7}}, "iteration": 0, "flow_step": "Entities design", "max_iteration": 0, "stack": "app_building_stack"}, {"question": null, "function": {"name": "register_workflow_with_app", "model_api": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.3, "max_tokens": 10000}}, "answer": null, "index": 0, "iteration": 0, "flow_step": "Additional logic code design", "max_iteration": 0, "stack": "api_request_stack", "publish": false}, {"question": "", "prompt": {}, "notification": null, "answer": "", "function": {}, "index": 0, "iteration": 0, "max_iteration": 0, "data": {}, "entity": {}, "file_name": "", "context": {}, "approve": true, "editable": false, "publish": false, "flow_step": "Additional logic code design"}, {"question": null, "prompt": {}, "answer": null, "function": {"name": "finish_flow"}, "index": 2, "iteration": 0, "file_name": "entity/chat.json", "notification_text": "\n\ud83c\udf89 **Chat flow has been saved!** \ud83c\udf89\n\nThe chat flow has been successfully saved to `entity/chat.json`.
