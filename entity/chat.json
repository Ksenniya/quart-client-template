We\u2019re excited to build something amazing with you! \ud83d\ude04  \n\nWe\u2019re here to help with building and deploying on Cyoda Cloud! Reach out anytime! \ud83c\udf1f Your branch will be ready soon, and I\u2019ll notify you when I push changes. If you have suggestions, message me or use Canvas! \ud83d\ude0a  \n\nIn Canvas, you can code, edit, and improve around the main app build flow! It\u2019s a great way to collaborate and make changes! \ud83d\udcbb  \n\nIf you\u2019re happy with the progress or want me to pull your changes, just give me a thumbs up! \ud83d\udc4d  (currently approve button in the top panel)\n\nIf something goes wrong, no worries\u2014just roll back! \ud83d\ude2c Your app will be live on Cyoda Platform GitHub soon! \ud83d\ude80 Let\u2019s build your branch together! \ud83c\udf3f", "publish": true, "allow_anonymous_users": true}, {"type": "function", "function": {"name": "clone_repo", "description": "Clones template repository"}, "publish": true, "allow_anonymous_users": true}, {"allow_anonymous_users": true, "publish": true, "notification": "\ud83c\udf89 **Your branch is ready!** Please update the project and check it out when you get a chance. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nTo get started:\n\n1. **Clone the repository** using the following command:  \n   `git clone https://github.com/Cyoda-platform/quart-client-template/` \ud83d\ude80\n\n2. **Checkout your branch** using:  \n   `git checkout b8a73c88-08ce-11f0-a044-40c2ba0ac9eb` \ud83d\udd04\n\nYou can access your branch directly on GitHub here: [Cyoda Platform GitHub](https://github.com/Cyoda-platform/quart-client-template/tree/b8a73c88-08ce-11f0-a044-40c2ba0ac9eb) \ud83d\ude04\n\nThis repository is a **starter template** for your app and has two main modules:\n\n- **Common Module**: This is all about integration with Cyoda!
