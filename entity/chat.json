Additional documentation can be created as the application expands.\n\n6. **Testing**:\n   - A plan to implement unit tests using pytest to ensure the application functions correctly.\n\nThese specifications will guide the initial development of the app. If you have specific features or changes you want to incorporate, please let me know.
