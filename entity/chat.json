For example, replace `CHAT_ID_VAR` with `$chat_id` and fill in other necessary values.\n\n    You might need to specify the path to .env file in your IDE run configurations.\n\n3. **Start Your Application**:\n    Once you've updated the `.env` file, you can start your application by running:\n    ```bash\n    python app.py\n    ```\n    or just run the app.py in your IDE.\nPlease also update your api.py files to use cyoda_token until authentication featute is fully implemented.

Should custom error messages be returned?\n\n4. **Concurrency**: Will the application handle multiple requests simultaneously? If so, how should it manage shared resources like `local_cache` to prevent data corruption?\n\n5. **Environment Configurations**: What specific data should be stored in `local_cache` for user environments? Should it include more than just `'env_config'`?\n\n6. **API Response Structure**: Are there any specific response structures or status codes you would like to standardize across endpoints?\n\n7. **Logging and Monitoring**: Should there be any logging or monitoring of API requests for debugging or performance tracking?\n\n8. **Future Integrations**: Are there other external services planned for integration that should be considered now for a better design?\n\nAnswering these questions will help refine your functional specifications and ensure the application meets your needs effectively.
