# Functional Requirements for the Project

## Overview
The application is designed to retrieve brand data from an external API and display the processed results to users. All processing logic, including external data retrieval and calculations, must be executed via POST endpoints. GET endpoints serve solely for retrieving and displaying the data stored or processed by the application.

## API Endpoints

### 1. POST /brands/fetch
- **Purpose:**  
  Invoke the external data source and perform any additional business logic.
  
- **Business Logic:**  
  - Make a GET request to "https://api.practicesoftwaretesting.com/brands".
  - Process/validate the received JSON (e.g., filtering, formatting).
  - Cache or store the processed results internally.

- **Request Format:**  
  No request body needed (or an optional body for triggering optional logic, if required).

- **Response Format:**  
  - **Success (HTTP 200):**  
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Brands fetched successfully.",
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "01JMWZK3N7PT3XMTMXMQTBACRV",
          "name": "ForgeFlex Tools",
          "slug": "forgeflex-tools"
        },
        {
          "id": "01JMWZK3N7PT3XMTMXMQTBACRW",
          "name": "MightyCraft Hardware",
          "slug": "mightycraft-hardware"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  - **Error:**  
    Appropriate HTTP status codes with error messages.

### 2. GET /brands
- **Purpose:**  
  Retrieve the processed/cached brand data for display in the application.

- **Request Format:**  
  No request body, possibly with query parameters for pagination or filtering.

- **Response Format:**  
  - **Success (HTTP 200):**  
    ```json
    {
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "01JMWZK3N7PT3XMTMXMQTBACRV",
          "name": "ForgeFlex Tools",
          "slug": "forgeflex-tools"
        },
        {
          "id": "01JMWZK3N7PT3XMTMXMQTBACRW",
          "name": "MightyCraft Hardware",
          "slug": "mightycraft-hardware"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  - **Error:**  
    Appropriate HTTP status codes with error messages.

## User-App Interaction

### Journey Diagram
```mermaid
journey
    title User and Application Journey
    section Initiate Data Fetch
      User: 5: Sends request to fetch brands via POST
      App: 4: Processes the request and retrieves external data
    section Data Retrieval
      App: 5: Stores and caches processed data
      User: 4: Retrieves stored data via GET
      App: 5: Displays the brands to the user
```

### Sequence Diagram
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant A as Application
    participant E as External API

    U->>A: POST /brands/fetch
    A->>E: GET https://api.practicesoftwaretesting.com/brands
    E-->>A: JSON Data Response
    A->>A: Process & cache data
    A-->>U: 200 OK with processed data message

    U->>A: GET /brands
    A->>A: Retrieve cached data
    A-->>U: 200 OK with data list
```

## Best Practices
- Use proper error handling and status codes.
- Secure the endpoints as needed, especially if further business logic or sensitive data processing is involved.
- Consider caching strategies to avoid overwhelming the external API with frequent requests.
