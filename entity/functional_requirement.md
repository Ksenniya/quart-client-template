Here are the finalized functional requirements for your project, formatted clearly for easy reference:

### Functional Requirements for London Houses Data Analysis System

#### 1. Data Download and Analysis
- **FR1**: The system shall provide an API endpoint to generate and analyze a report based on London Houses data.
  - **FR1.1**: The API endpoint shall be `POST /report/generate`.
  - **FR1.2**: The request to the endpoint shall include a JSON object with the following structure:
    ```json
    {
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cyoda-platform/cyoda-ai/refs/heads/ai-2.x/data/test-inputs/v1/connections/london_houses.csv"
    }
    ```
  - **FR1.3**: The system shall download the CSV file from the specified URL using an HTTP GET request.
  - **FR1.4**: The system shall validate that the download is successful and the file is not corrupted.

#### 2. Data Loading and Analysis
- **FR2**: The system shall load the downloaded CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
  - **FR2.1**: The system shall validate the presence and integrity of the expected columns: 
    - Address
    - Neighborhood
    - Bedrooms
    - Bathrooms
    - Square Meters
    - Building Age
    - Garden
    - Garage
    - Floors
    - Property Type
    - Heating Type
    - Balcony
    - Interior Style
    - View
    - Materials
    - Building Status
    - Price (Â£)
  - **FR2.2**: The system shall handle any data inconsistencies or missing values gracefully.
  - **FR2.3**: The system shall perform data analysis to compute key statistics, including:
    - Average price of houses.
    - Distribution of property types.
    - Summary statistics for numerical fields (e.g., Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Square Meters).

#### 3. Report Generation
- **FR3**: The system shall return the analysis results in JSON format.
  - **FR3.1**: The JSON response shall include the following structure:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "report": {
        "average_price": 1500000,
        "property_distribution": {
          "Apartment": 40,
          "Semi-Detached": 30,
          ...
        },
        "summary_statistics": {
          "average_bedrooms": 3,
          "average_bathrooms": 2,
          "average_square_meters": 150
        },
        "visualizations": {
          "price_distribution_chart": "URL_to_chart",
          "property_type_distribution_chart": "URL_to_chart"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### Acceptance Criteria
- The CSV file is successfully downloaded from the provided URL.
- The data is correctly loaded into a pandas DataFrame with validated columns.
- The analysis includes computation of key statistics and returns a comprehensive JSON report.
- The system handles errors and logs issues as specified.
