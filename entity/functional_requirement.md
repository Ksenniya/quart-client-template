Action: example_function: 9a5c8b9f-fe17-11ef-97c8-40c2ba0ac9eb, "# Functional Requirements\n\nThe project must implement a backend application with the following functionalities:\n\n- A POST endpoint for invoking external API calls, processing data, and performing any necessary calculations.\n- A GET endpoint strictly for retrieving previously processed and stored results.\n- The external data source is located at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1, and retrieval must be triggered exclusively through the POST endpoint.\n- Business logic that involves external data retrieval, processing, or calculations must run within the POST endpoint.\n- Both endpoints must follow RESTful conventions.\n\n# API Endpoints\n\n## POST /data_sources\n- **Description**: Invokes an external API request to fetch data from the specified external source, processes it based on business logic, and returns the computed result.\n- **Request Format**:\n  - Headers: Content-Type: application/json\n  - Body (optional parameters, if any):\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"parameters\": {\n        \"optional_parameter1\": \"value\",\n        \"optional_parameter2\": \"value\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n- **Response Format**:\n  - Status: 200 OK (on success)\n  - Body:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"success\",\n      \"data\": {\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"...\",\n        \"body\": \"...\",\n        \"processedResult\": \"result after business logic\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n## GET /results\n- **Description**: Retrieves the processed results stored by the backend, without triggering any external calls.\n- **Request Format**:\n  - Headers: Content-Type: application/json\n- **Response Format**:\n  - Status: 200 OK (on success)\n  - Body:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"status\": \"success\",\n      \"results\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": 1,\n          \"data\": {\n            \"title\": \"...\",\n            \"body\": \"...\",\n            \"processedResult\": \"result after business logic\"\n          }\n        }\n        // ... additional results if available\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n# Mermaid Diagrams\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant U as User\n    participant A as App Backend\n    participant E as External Data Source\n\n    U->>A: POST /data_sources\n    A->>E: GET https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1\n    E-->>A: Response Data\n    A->>A: Process Data & Perform Calculations\n    A-->>U: JSON Response (Processed Data)\n\n    U->>A: GET /results\n    A-->>U: JSON Response (Stored Results)\n```\n\n```mermaid\njourney\n    title User Interaction with Backend\n    section Data Fetching and Processing\n      User sends POST request to fetch and process data: 3: User, App\n      App retrieves external data and processes it: 5: App, External API\n    section Results Retrieval\n      User sends GET request for stored results: 2: User, App\n      App returns processed results: 4: App\n```", functional_requirements.md
