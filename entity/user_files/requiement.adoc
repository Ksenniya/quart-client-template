= London Houses Data Analysis Requirement
== Introduction

This document specifies the formal requirements for a system to download, analyze, and report on London Houses data. The system will retrieve data from a specified URL, process it using the Python pandas library, and generate a report based on the analysis.

== Scope

The system shall:
* Download a CSV file containing London Houses data.
* Load and analyze the data using pandas.
* Generate and save an analysis report.

== Data Source

The data is available via an HTTP GET request at the following URL:

GET https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cyoda-platform/cyoda-ai/refs/heads/ai-2.x/data/test-inputs/v1/connections/london_houses.csv

The CSV file includes the following columns:
* Address
* Neighborhood
* Bedrooms
* Bathrooms
* Square Meters
* Building Age
* Garden
* Garage
* Floors
* Property Type
* Heating Type
* Balcony
* Interior Style
* View
* Materials
* Building Status
* Price (Â£)

== Functional Requirements

.**Data Download**
**FR1.1**: The system shall download the CSV file from the specified URL using an HTTP GET request.
**FR1.2**: The system shall verify that the download is successful and the file is not corrupted.

.**Data Loading and Analysis**
**FR2.1**: The system shall load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
**FR2.2**: The system shall validate the presence and integrity of the expected columns.
**FR2.3**: The system shall perform data analysis to compute key statistics, such as:
   * Average price of houses.
   * Distribution of property types.
   * Summary statistics for numerical fields (e.g., Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Square Meters).
**FR2.4**: The system shall handle any data inconsistencies or missing values gracefully.

.**Report Generation**
**FR3.1**: The system shall generate a comprehensive report summarizing the analysis.
**FR3.2**: The report shall include:
   * Key metrics and statistical summaries.
   * Visualizations (e.g., charts or graphs) where applicable.
**FR3.3**: The system shall save the report to disk in a specified format (e.g., PDF or HTML).

== Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR1**: The system shall be implemented using Python (version 3.7 or later).
* **NFR2**: The system shall utilize the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
* **NFR3**: The system shall be modular to facilitate future enhancements.
* **NFR4**: The system shall include error handling for network failures, data inconsistencies, and any other potential issues.
* **NFR5**: The system shall provide logging to assist in debugging and monitoring.

== Acceptance Criteria

* The CSV file is successfully downloaded from the provided URL.
* The data is correctly loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
* The analysis includes computation of key statistics and visualizations.
* A report is generated and saved to disk in the agreed format.
* The system handles errors and logs issues as specified.
