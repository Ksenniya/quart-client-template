Hello! I’d like an application that retrieves the current Bitcoin-to-USD and Bitcoin-to-EUR conversion rates, then sends these rates in an email report. The application should provide two endpoints:

POST /job

Initiates the report creation process and stores the results as a “report.”
Fetches the latest BTC/USD and BTC/EUR rates and triggers the email send.
GET /report by id

Retrieves the stored report by its ID.
Returns the previously generated conversion rate information.
