= Ingestion and Combined Link Entities Requirement Specification

== Overview

The system shall ingest data from two external APIs that provide hydrometric station information. It will extract link objects from both responses, combine them, and store each unique link in a persistent Link Entity.

== Data Sources

=== Hydrometric Monitoring Stations Collection

* **Endpoint:**  
  `https://api.weather.gc.ca/collections/hydrometric-stations?f=json&lang=en-CA`
* **Response Characteristics:**  
  Returns a JSON object that includes metadata such as `id`, `title`, `description`, and a `links` array containing link objects (e.g., type, rel, title, href, hreflang).

=== Hydrometric Monitoring Stations Items

* **Endpoint:**  
  `https://api.weather.gc.ca/collections/hydrometric-stations/items?f=json&lang=en-CA&limit=10&additionalProp1=%7B%7D&skipGeometry=false&offset=0`
* **Response Characteristics:**  
  Returns a GeoJSON FeatureCollection. Each feature in the `features` array contains a `properties` object, which in turn contains its own `links` array with similar link objects.

== Functional Requirements

=== Data Retrieval

. The system shall perform a GET request to the **Collection** endpoint to retrieve station metadata.
. The system shall perform a GET request to the **Items** endpoint to retrieve individual station details.

=== Link Extraction

. From the **Collection** endpoint response, the system shall extract the `links` array.
. From the **Items** endpoint response, the system shall iterate over each feature in the `features` array and extract any `links` arrays found within the `properties` object.

=== Link Combination and Normalization

. The system shall combine the link objects from both data sources into a unified collection.
. Each link object shall be normalized into a Link Entity containing the following attributes:
  * **type**
  * **rel**
  * **title**
  * **href**
  * **hreflang** (if available)
. The system shall check for duplicates (e.g., based on the `href` or a combination of attributes) and ensure that each unique link is stored only once or merged appropriately.

=== Persistence

. The system shall persist each normalized Link Entity into the designated data store.
. The persistence mechanism shall support idempotency to avoid duplicate records during repeated ingestions.

=== Error Handling & Logging

. The system shall log any errors encountered during API requests, data extraction, or persistence.
. If one API fails or returns invalid data, the system shall continue processing the other API and include error details in the log for further investigation.

== Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:**  
  The ingestion process should complete within an acceptable time frame to not delay downstream processes.
* **Reliability:**  
  The process must be resilient to intermittent network issues or API failures.
* **Scalability:**  
  The design should allow for additional endpoints or data sources in the future without significant changes to the extraction logic.

== Acceptance Criteria

1. **Successful Data Fetching:**  
   When the ingestion process is triggered, data is successfully fetched from both the collection and items endpoints.
2. **Link Extraction & Combination:**  
   All link objects from both endpoints are correctly extracted, combined, and normalized into Link Entities.
3. **Deduplication:**  
   The system stores only unique Link Entities, with duplicates merged or skipped.
4. **Data Persistence:**  
   Link Entities are persisted in the data store and can be retrieved for further use.
5. **Error Logging:**  
   Any errors during the ingestion process are logged, and a failure in one API does not halt the entire process.

== Conclusion

This specification outlines the process for ingesting, processing, and storing combined link information from the provided API endpoints.
