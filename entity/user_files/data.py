### Setup Instructions for Your Application

Your application is ready! Please fetch the changes and follow the steps below to configure it:

1. **Move the `.env.template` to `.env`**:
    Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env`:
    ```bash
    mv .env.template .env
    ```

2. **Update the `.env` file**:
    Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder values with your actual environment variables and credentials. For example, replace `CHAT_ID_VAR` with `$chat_id` and fill in other necessary values.

    You might need to specify the path to .env file in your IDE run configurations.

3. **Start Your Application**:
    Once you've updated the `.env` file, you can start your application by running:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    or just run the app.py in your IDE.
Please also update your api.py files to use cyoda_token until authentication featute is fully implemented. Sorry for inconvenience!
Your application should now be up and running! üéâ

You can check the api with http://localhost:8000/docs

Which workflow would you recommend for this code?  
Could you split this code into functions, each function should have name starting with 'process_'. These functions are async (example: async process_{{entity_name}}(entity: dict): )
It can take only one argument entity data and can modify this entity data state, so please also remove any unnecessary entity_service.update(this entity) calls = as you can do it by changing entity attributes directly, e.g. entity['attribute'] = new_value.
No more additional arguments can be passed.
Also, all workflow orchestration should be inside {workflow_function}. {workflow_function} should have only workflow orchestration code and no business logic. no other function can have workflow orchestration code.

You cannot apply entity_service.add/update/delete on the current entity (passed as argument)! if you need to change this entity state - modify directly  e.g. entity['attribute'].  The new state will be persisted. Do not any test/extra code.

The FSM consists of states and transitions between them, which can be represented as a directed graph where states are nodes, and transitions are edges.
Each transition may have processes. You need to add them if the user explicitly specifies them. Currently there can be only one transition coming from a single state.
Each state, except for the initial state (None), should be reachable from exactly one transition, ensuring that there are no isolated (disconnected) states in the workflow. Additionally, each transition must have both a start state and an end state.

Begin with an initial state labeled "None", which serves as the origin point.
Define transitions between states, with each state being an endpoint (i.e., target) of exactly one transition.
Ensure that all states (except "None") serve as the destination for exactly one transition to guarantee the graph remains fully connected.

What do you think, can we move any logic from the endpoint inside newly added functions (workflow=process_{entity_name}) that will be invoked right before persisting entity.
It will make our code more robust and will 'free' the controllers from excessive logic.
Any async task (including fire and forget functions) is definitely a candidate to be replaced with process_{entity_name} function as workflow function supports asynchronous code and is a direct alternative for such tasks. It is the right approach - this is required.
Workflow function applied to the entity asynchronously before persistence. this function takes this entity data as the only argument. You can change entity state inside this function e.g. entity['attribute'] = new_value
You can get and add secondary/supplementary/raw data entities of a different entity_model
You cannot apply entity_service.add/update/delete on the current entity! if you need to change this entity state - modify directly  e.g. entity['attribute'].  The new state will be persisted.

You are provided with a Python codebase that implements a REST API (using a framework like Quart, Flask, etc.). Currently, the code uses local in‚Äëmemory dictionaries (and counters) to store and manage data for one or more entity types. Your task is to refactor the code so that all interactions with the local cache are replaced by calls to an external service called entity_service (from app_init.app_init import entity_service).
You can use only these functions for replacement - if this is not enough just skip and leave as is
1.
id = await entity_service.add_item(
    token=cyoda_token,
    entity_model="{entity_name}",
    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,  # always use this constant
    entity=data  # the validated data object
)
just return id in the response - you cannot immediately retrieve the result - it should be retrieved via separate endpoint
2. Data retrieval: 
await entity_service.get_item(
    token=cyoda_token,
    entity_model="{entity_name}",
    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,
    technical_id=<id>
)
await entity_service.get_items(
    token=cyoda_token,
    entity_model="{entity_name}",
    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,
)
await entity_service.get_items_by_condition(
    token=cyoda_token,
    entity_model="{entity_name}",
    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,
    condition=condition
)
3. 
await entity_service.update_item(
    token=cyoda_token,
    entity_model="{entity_name}",
    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,  # always use this constant
    entity=data,
    technical_id=id,
    meta={}
)
4.
await entity_service.delete_item(
    token=cyoda_token,
    entity_model="{entity_name}",
    entity_version=ENTITY_VERSION,  # always use this constant
    technical_id=id,
    meta={}
)
use 'from common.config.config import ENTITY_VERSION' to import ENTITY_VERSION
Add this code:
```
from common.repository.cyoda.cyoda_init import init_cyoda
from app_init.app_init import cyoda_token
@app.before_serving
async def startup():
    await init_cyoda(cyoda_token)
```
Preserve the endpoint routes and any other essential business logic.
Please make sure you keep all the necessary business logic, like data ingestion, calling any external apis , mocks, calculations etc
Please return only compiled python code without additional information. If you'd like to add any comments please use # comment

Awesome! Let's dive into generating your application code! üöÄ 

I'll keep you updated with notifications on my progress, and let you know when it's time to discuss any changes.
 
Feel free to grab a coffee ‚òï while I work‚Äîit's going to take about 2 minutes. 
 
Just relax and wait for the update!

In this process, we will walk through each stage of building an application, from gathering initial requirements to designing, coding, and implementing the final logic.

### The stages of the process are as follows:

1. **Entities design**:  
   Let's define the JSON data structure for each entity.
   *Output documents*: entity/*

2. **Workflow design**:  
   Let's ensure our entity workflow is correctly defined.
   *Output documents*: entity/*/workflow.json

3. **Workflow processors code design**:  
   Let's implement the workflow processors.
   *Output documents*: entity/*/workflow.py

Congratulations on successfully completing your application prototype!ü•≥
 
You‚Äôve put in a lot of hard work to bring your idea to life, and it‚Äôs truly exciting to see it in action. 

ü™Öü™Öü™ÖThis is an important milestone‚Äîwell done!ü™Öü™Öü™Ö

However, as impressive as your prototype is, it‚Äôs not yet fully robust. A few critical components are missing:

**Scalability and High Availability**

**Persistence and Data Integrity**

**Production-Ready Features**

To address these gaps and ensure your application can handle real-world demands, we recommend refactoring your solution using the Cyoda Framework. By deploying to a High Availability (HA) cluster on Cyoda Cloud, you‚Äôll benefit from:

**Enterprise-grade reliability and failover capabilities**

**Seamless data persistence**

**Streamlined deployment and scaling processes**

**A comprehensive set of production-ready tools and services**

We believe this transformation will empower your application to reach its full potential. Would you like to proceed with refactoring your prototype to make it robust, production-ready, and fully deployable on Cyoda Cloud?

Just give me a thumbs up! üëç

from dataclasses import dataclass
from quart_schema import QuartSchema, validate_request, validate_response

app = Quart(__name__)
QuartSchema(app)

@dataclass
class Todo:
    task: str #please use only primitives

post/put request: 
@app.route("/test", methods=["POST"]) - this line should go first in post method
@validate_request(Todo)
async def create_todo(data: Todo)

get request with request parameters:
@validate_querystring(Todo) - this line should go first in get method
@app.route("/test", methods=["GET"])
async def get_todo() #cannot put body to GET request! - please make sure you do not pass any arguments! it will throw ar error. only post and put can have body

get request without request parameters *no validation needed*:
@app.route("/companies/<string:id>/lei", methods=["GET"])

Correct example:
@validate_querystring(Todo) - this line should go first in get
@app.route("/test", methods=["GET"])
async def todo():
 name = request.args.get('name') #use standard approach to access parameters values for GET requests, you cannot access Todo in GET

Wrong example:
@app.route("/test", methods=["GET"])
@validate_querystring(Todo)- this line should go first in get
async def todo(query_args: Todo): - do not do like this please

Correct example:
@app.route("/test", methods=["POST"]) - this line should go first in post method
@validate_request(Todo) - this line should go second in post method, but first in get
async def create_todo(data: Todo)


Wrong example:
@validate_request(Todo) - this line should go second in post method, but first in get
@app.route("/test", methods=["POST"]) - this line should go first in post method
async def create_todo(data: Todo)

I know this iss confusing - i think there is an issue in quart schema library so we have to workaround this issue:
Always put validation first for GET requests, and last for POST requests. Reason about this issue and make correct decision.
Also put a comment that it is an issue workaround, so that everyone knows the logic behind.
Please return only compiled python code without additional information. If you'd like to add any comments please use # comment

Now that we‚Äôve finalized the API design, please provide the code for the prototype.py file.
The implementation should be a working prototype rather than a fully robust solution. 
Incorporate any details I‚Äôve already specified‚Äîsuch as external APIs, models, or specific calculations‚Äîand use mocks or placeholders only where requirements are unclear or incomplete. 
Wherever you introduce a mock or placeholder, include a TODO comment to indicate the missing or uncertain parts. 
The goal is to verify the user experience (UX) and identify any gaps in the requirements before we proceed with a more thorough implementation.
Please double-check you are using all the information provided earlier. Use aiohttp.ClientSession for http requests, and Quart api. 
Use QuartSchema(app) but do not add any @validate_request as our data is dynamic, just add QuartSchema(app) one line.
Use this entry point: if __name__ == '__main__':app.run(use_reloader=False, debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8000, threaded=True).
Mock any persistence, do not use any particular implementation, just local cache (e.g. you cannot use sqlalchemy in the prototype or any external implementation for persistence or cache).
You are most welcome to use such pattern where it is reasonable:
entity_job[job_id] = {"status": "processing", "requestedAt": requested_at}
# Fire and forget the processing task.
await asyncio.create_task(process_entity(entity_job, data.__dict__))
